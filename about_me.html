			Hi! My name is Laura and I am an aspiring web developer. I've spent years dabbling in code, but recently took a leap and reached out to the local programming communty. I learned about all the moving parts of creating a webpage and it all just clicked for me. I have been coding every day since and I love it! Thanks for visiting my first real webpage!
